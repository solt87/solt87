About my GitHub presence
------------------------

I moved my personal repositories to [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~solt87/); you can access them
[here][srhtrepo].

I try to decrease my use of and reliance on GitHub. I currently
only use it to follow projects hosted on GitHub, and to contribute
to some of them.

To learn about the problems with GitHub, I recommend that you read
[this article][ynotgh]. (It also contains links to other articles on
the same topic.)


About me
--------

My name is Solt Budav√°ri (pronounced as "sholt").
I am a free software enthusiast.

My main interests (within IT) are:

- free (as in freedom) operating systems

    I like and use Linux-based operating systems, I'm
    most familiar with [Debian][debian] and its derivatives.

    I'm also interested in BSD's, mostly in [OpenBSD][openbsd].

    I use the [OpenWRT][openwrt] router firmware where I can.

- [free (as in freedom) software][freesoftware]

- [plain-text based][composition] document creation and
  software configuration

  - light-weight markup languages like [Markdown][markdown-page] and
    [AsciiDoc][asciidoc-page]

  - converting light-weight markup documents to other formats with
    software such as [lowdown][lowdown-page] or [Pandoc][pandoc].

  - creating web sites from light-weight markup documents with
    software such as [MkDocs][mkdocs] or [ssg][ssg-page].

  - [plain-text configuration files][plainconf]

      Plain-text configuration files can (in better cases) be read by
      humans, they can be modified by standard tools working with plain
      text, and they can be committed to a version control system.

  - [infrastructure as code][infraascode]

      Using plain-text files to describe the state/configuration of
      systems can help create automated and version-controlled workflows,
      which means less manual work, and more transparency and
      ease of reproduction. See e.g. [Ansible][ansible] and [YAML][yaml].

- automation -- because [manual work is a bug][mwiab]. :)
